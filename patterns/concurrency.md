# concurrency

Swift 6 concurrency patterns used in FitToday. This guide covers async/await, actors, sendable conformance, task groups, and @MainActor usage. Works alongside the swift-concurrency skill which provides 13 reference files.

## Core Patterns

(Patterns will be added as they are captured and processed)

## Skill Integration

The swift-concurrency skill (.claude/skills/swift-concurrency/) covers:
- Async/await basics, actors, tasks, sendable, async sequences
- Threading, memory management, performance, testing
- Core Data concurrency, migration to Swift 6, linting

Patterns captured here extend and contextualize what the skill teaches with FitToday-specific decisions.

## Open Questions

- Which concurrency patterns cause the most issues in the project?
- How does strict concurrency checking interact with third-party dependencies?
