# testing

Testing patterns for FitToday. This guide covers XCTest approaches, test doubles (spies, stubs, mocks, fixtures), coverage strategies, and ViewModel testing patterns.

## Core Patterns

(Patterns will be added as they are captured and processed)

## Standards

- Unit tests for all ViewModels
- Unit tests for layers of logic
- Use spies, stubs, mocks and fixtures to simulate real data
- XCTest framework (primary)
- Minimum 70% code coverage for business logic
- No UITests during scaffolding phase

## Open Questions

- Which testing patterns reduce boilerplate most effectively?
- How to test async/await ViewModels reliably?
